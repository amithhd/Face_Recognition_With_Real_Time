## Description

This project implements face recognition with real-time capabilities using python, Opencv. It utilizes Python 3.7, higherOpenCV, cvzone, numpy, face_recognition, Firebase Admin SDK to achieve accurate and efficient face recognition in real-time scenarios.

## Requirements

- Web Cam
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- numpy
- face_recognition
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Visual Studio


## Installation

### Requirements

  * Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
  * macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

### Installation Options:

#### Installing on Mac or Linux

First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

  * [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)
  
Then, make sure you have cmake installed:
